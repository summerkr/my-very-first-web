<p><h3>Some type of love</h3>
<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Puth" target="_blank" title="Philmography of Charlie puth">Charlie Puth</a>
<p>When I'm old and grown
<br>I won't sleep alone, no
<br>Every single moment
<br>will be feeding into you
<br>That's some type of love
That's some type of love</p>
<p>And I won't sing the blues
Cause all I need is you
Every single question
will be answered all by you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love</p>
<p>When the world's on fire
We won't even move
There is no reason
if I'm here with you
And when it's said and done
I'll give me to you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love
When we're old and gray
And our faces changed
There won't be a moment
when my heart don't feel the same
That's some type of love
That's some type of love
And every story ends
But we could still pretend
Every single moment will be
just as we had planned
It was some type of love
That's some type of love
When the world's on fire
We won't even move
There is no reason
if I'm here with you
And when it's said and done
I'll give me to you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love
I'll be with you
Give me to you, baby
That's some type of love
That's some type of love
When the world's on fire
We won't even move
There is no reason
if I'm here with you
And when it's said and done
I'll give me to you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love
