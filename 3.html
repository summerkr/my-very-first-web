<h3>Yacht (feat.Sik-K)</h3>
<p>
  I should buy a yacht just to take you on it
Wanna take you 'round the town just to watch you flaunt it
You're so pleasing to the eye, I'm just being honest
For you, I'm not ever broke, empty out my pockets
You're mine, dude, so high, baby
Work, girl, work like Rihanna
Girl, you know I don't ever lie
This a song I wrote just for my baby
I can't have you in the over, girl
I can't have you in the lonesome, girl
'Cause too many dudes be hoping, girl
Scheming, they wanna steal my girl
Oh no, that won't ever, ever happen
'Cause I'm that fly Asian guy, I'm the captain
I be so wavy when whatever I be bragging
Get you in submission all night, you be tapping, ya
Taking it from coast to coast
Scuba diving in the ocean shore
