  <h3>Zero</h3>
  <p>I thought we were great
You took your love back and ran us off track
I counted all the days
'Til you would come back. How stupid was that?

Now you're missing what we used to have
Guess the vodka brought the feeling back
I was caught up in the aftermath
But now, if you really want to know

Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero
Gave a hundred percent but all I got from you, zero, zero
I thought you were the one, then you turned around
Found somebody better, like I never met ya
Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero
(zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero)
That's how many fucks I give
